# Brief History
![](history.png)

---
# Basic Definitions and Notations
* Treatment:  $A={0,1}$

* Observed Outcome: $Y={0,1}$

* Potential Outcomes: $Y^0, Y^1$

* Counterfactural 
  
  If one outcome is $Y^a$ the other one is $Y^{1-a}$

* Causal Effects: $Y^1 \neq Y^0$

---
# Fundamental Problem of Causal Inference

* It is impossible to observe two outcomes simultaneously.

* However with certain assumptions we can estimate population level (average) causal effects.

---
# Average Causal Effect

* $E(Y^1-Y^0)=-0.1$

* with 1000 people 100 fewer with treatment A than treatment B

---
# Conditioning vs. Setting

In general 

$E(Y^1-Y^0) \neq E(Y|A=1)-E(Y|A=0)$

$E(Y|A=1)$ is subpopulation who actually had $A=1$

$E(Y^1)$ means the whole population was actually treated with $A=1$

---
# Other Causal Effects

$E(Y^1/Y^0)$ Causal relative risk

$E(Y^1-Y^0|A=1)$ Causal effect of treatment on treated

$E(Y^1-Y^0|V=v)$ average causal effect in the subpopulation with covariate $V=v$ heterogeneity treatment effects

---
# Causal Assumptions 
* SUTVA stable unit treatment value assumptions
  * No interference: 
    * units do not interfere with each other 
    * Treatment assignmentof one unit does not affect that outcome of another unit
    * Spillover or contagion are also terms for interference
  * One version of treatment

* Consistency $Y=Y^a$ if $A=a$ for all a

* Ignorability $Y^0,Y^1\perp \!\!\! \perp A|X$ Among people with the same values of $X$, we can think of treatment $A$ as being randomly assigned.

* Positivity: for every sef of values for $X$, treatment assignment was not deterministic:
$P(A=a|X=x)>0$ for all $a$ and $x$

# Observed Data

$E(Y|A=a,X=x)$

$= E(Y^a | A=a,X=x)$ (consistency)

$= E(Y^a | X=x)$ (ignorability)

---
# Mean Potential Outcome by standardization

$E(Y^a) = \Sigma_xE(Y|A=a,X=x)P(X=x)$

problem: could be many varibles in $X$, combinations of variables creat missing values

---
# Confounding

get rid of counfounder by randomization

# Matching(one covariate, multiple covariates)

* fine balance
* stochastic balance
* one to one
* one to many
* variable (sometimes one to one, sometimes one to many)
* Distance
  * Mahalanobis
  * robust version (use ranks instead to solve issue of outliers)
* Greedy matching(R package matchit)
  * Caliper (maximum acceptable distance)
* optimal matching (R package optmatch,rcbalance)

---
# Accessing Balance

* Standardized differences (similar means)
  $smd=\frac{ \bar{X}_{treatment} -  \bar{X}_{control}}{ \sqrt{  \frac{S^2_{treatment}+S^2_{control}}{2} }  }$
  * <0.1 indicate adequate balance
  * 0.1-0.2 not too alarming
  * \>0.2 indicate serious imbalance
   
* Table 1 (prematching and post-matching balance is compared) + SMD plot
  ![](accessing_balance.png)

* Hypothesis test and p-values (test for differences in means for each covariate -- two sample t-test) 



---
# Analyze Data After Matching

* Randomization test (Permutation test, Exact test) R package (McNemar.test) or t.test for continuous data



---
# Sensitivity analysis

* Possible hidden bias


---
# Propensity Score
